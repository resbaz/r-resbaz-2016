  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  This page contains the schedule and lesson notes for the R stream at ResBaz 2016 hosted at 
  The University of Melbourne from February 1st - 3rd.
</p>
<p>
  The lessons for the R stream have been developed by the international 
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a> community, whose mission
  is to help researchers get more done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  This hands-on workshop will cover basic
  concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data
  management, and task automation.  Participants will be encouraged to
  help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    For more information on what we teach and why,
    please see our paper
    "<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745">Best Practices for Scientific Computing</a>".

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->
<h2 id="setup">Workshop Setup</h2>
<h3>Create a GitHub account</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is an online hosting service for all your code.
  We'll be using it in the lesson on version control,
  and GitHub credentials are used for login authentication on DIT4C.
  GitHub accounts are free, so sign up for one if you don't already have an account.
</p>
<h3>Login to DIT4C</h3>
<p>
  During the first session of the workshop, the instructors will give you the
  compute node name and access code you'll need for the Data Intensive Tools for
  the Cloud (DIT4C) environment that is hosted on the NeCTAR Research Cloud. Once you've
  got that name and code, navigate to the
  <a href="http://resbaz.cloud.edu.au/ ">DIT4C homepage</a>
  (it works best in the Chrome browser) and follow these instructions:
  <ol>
    <li>Click the "login" button and proceed to login using your GitHub credentials.</li>
    <li>Go to the "compute nodes" tab and click "claim compute node access".</li>
    <li>From the drop down menu, select the name of the compute node that the instructor
    gave you and enter the corresponding access code.</li>
    <li>Go to the "containers" tab and add a new container named after yourself
    (e.g. johnsmith). The reason for this is that container names are unique (i.e. you can't
    have the same container name as anyone else in the room). 
    Select the "RStudio" image from the drop down menu, set the initial state to on
    and then hit the create button.</li>
    <li>When the container is "on", its name should turn blue and you can click on it to
    launch your environment in a new tab of your browser.</li>
    <li>Once you're finished for the day, simply close all the extra tabs that have opened up
    and turn your container "off". When you come back tomorrow, simply switch back to the 'on'
    position to continue using that container.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="setup">Post-workshop software installation instructions</h2>

<p>
  The DIT4C environment comes with all the required software pre-installed, 
  however if you would like to install the software on your own computer 
  (either before or after the workshop),
  here are the instructions to do so.
</p>

<p>
  A list of common issues that occur during installation and their fixes can be found here. Ignore the sections on Python and SQL.

<div id="shell"> <!-- Start of 'shell' section. -->
  <h3>The Bash Shell</h3>

  <p>
    Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
    tasks more quickly.
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Install Git for Windows by downloading and running
        <a href="http://msysgit.github.io/">the installer</a>.
        This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash, so no
        need to install anything.  You access bash from the Terminal
        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want to keep
        Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell is usually Bash, but if your
        machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
        terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to
        install anything.

<div id='git'> <!-- Start of 'Git' section. GitHub browser compatability
           is given at https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/-->
  <h3>Git</h3>

  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash
        install (described above).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>For OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
        by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
        install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
        <code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run
        <code>sudo yum install git</code>.

<div id="editor"> <!-- Start of 'editor' section. -->
  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.
